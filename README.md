# Virtual Memory Dashboard

# Introduction
The Virtual Memory Dashboard is a monitoring tool designed to provide insights into system virtual memory utilization. It offers visual representations of key metrics, such as memory usage, swap space, and page table statistics, enabling users to optimize system performance and resource allocation.

# Supported Metrics
The dashboard supports the following virtual memory metrics:
1)Total Memory Usage: Displays the total memory usage of the system.<br />
2)Swap Space Utilization: Visualizes the utilization of swap space, providing insights into virtual memory management.<br />
3)Page Table Statistics: Tracks page table entries, page faults, and other relevant metrics to monitor memory management efficiency.<br />

# Features
1)Interactive Visualization: Users can interact with the dashboard to explore virtual memory metrics dynamically.<br />
2)Real-Time Monitoring: Provides real-time updates on virtual memory usage, enabling proactive system management.<br />
3)Customizable Alerts: Users can set custom alerts based on predefined thresholds for memory usage and other metrics.<br />
4)Historical Data Analysis: Offers historical data analysis tools to identify trends and patterns in virtual memory utilization over time.<br />

# Configuration
Customize dashboard settings, such as data refresh intervals and alert thresholds, in the configuration file (config.json).<br />

# Dashboard Interface
1)Memory Overview: Provides a summary of total memory usage and swap space utilization.<br />
2)Memory Trends: Visualizes memory usage trends over time, allowing users to identify patterns and anomalies.<br />
3)Page Table Metrics: Displays page table statistics, including page faults, page table size, and other relevant metrics.<br />
4)Customizable Alerts: Allows users to configure custom alerts for memory usage and other critical metrics.<br />
